obsidian
========

__obsidian__ is a source port of Doom forked from [Chocolate Doom](http://chocolate-doom.org/).
It aims to provide smooth client-server multiplayer to Choco's faithful, classic Doom gameplay,
while putting in tasteful new features that don't deviate too far from classic Doom.

Obsidian is still in early development, but is already fairly playable, you can join up to IRC
at #obsidian on irc.oftc.net if you have any questions.
