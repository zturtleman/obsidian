Obsidian Roadmap (in order?)

Netcode:

 -- Implement MSG_PICKUP in a sane fashion. [Done unless something pops up]
 -- Work on making netcode play a little better, there are many problems with this currently (and not surprisingly). [In-progress]
 -- Implement game snapshots upon connect, theoretically, these could also be sent to terribly desynced clients.
 -- Add unlagged, this is a must-have for various reasons. [In-Progress]
 -- Netdemos on both client and server (simple write to buffer and read back).
 -- Team Deathmatch and CTF.

Engine:

 -- Extend MAXPLAYERS limit, preferrably maintaining vanilla demo compatibility, Odamex does this so we can too.
 -- Flat lists, so UDMX, UDM3, and several other maps do not crash the engine.
 -- High-Res video modes.

Fancy Stuff That May Never Happen:

 -- Partial Boom support.
 -- Medals and/or kill spree messages.
 -- Console (using a Python interpreter).
